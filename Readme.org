#+TITLE: Ambrose Field: Frozen Voyagers
Multichannel Audio

* Information
Duration: 7 mins 37 seconds
Format: Multichannel 24bit audio, 1 file per channel. 
8 main channels, plus 2 subwoofer channels (optional). 
Decoded from an Ambisonics Source.
Date of composition: 2013

* About the work

This repository contains the audio work /Frozen Voyagers/ - a multichannel audio work.
Frozen Voyagers was first performed in the RML Cinechamber at the MUTEK festival Canada, 2014.

The recording available here is losslessly compressed and will unpack to 24-bit, 
48khz multichannel sound suitable for public presentation. 

The work uses a mixture of environmental recorded sound and synthesis. It has been edited in the style of a 1950s musique concrete piece, with a helping of contemporary digital attitude.

* What to do with the files

The audio is losslessly encoded in flac, in 24-bit files at 48kHz 
to fit within the filesize limitations of GitHub. 

You can convert flac to wav as follows:

1. Obtain a flac decoder or use REAPER to playback.

Flac is a lossless audio compressor to save filespace. Decode as follows - either:

- use REAPER, which natively understands flac files. Open the files so that they all line up at start time 0 - take care not to offset or unpredictable results will occur (could be interesting!). 

- Alternatively you can use the free command line flac decoder from https://xiph.org/flac/. Having installed flac, use flac -d on each flac file to create the wav files.

* Now assign the speakers.

There is one file per loudspeaker channel. Arrangement, in a circle:

Front left  - 1
Front  centre - 2
Front  right - 3
Right center - 4 

Back  Right - 5
Back  Center - 6
Back  Left  - 7
Left center - 8

PLUS 2 Individual LFE Feeds with different content:-

SUB BASS A - 9
SUB BASS B - 10

Move to about 3 mins 33 to set your levels: things really start to kick off here. Each of the LFE channels is independent for special effects (yes, bass I think can be heard directionally).  If you only have one subwoofer then combine the channels. If you don't have a sub-bass channel but have great full range speakers then just combine the bass channels sensibly into the mains. If you don't have great full range speakers then just forget about the bass channels as they will over modulate everything due to some pretty extreme LF in places. 

* Technical notes on the realisation

The multichannel panning in this piece was made through using Ambisonics. Third Order ambisonics was used to achieve precise spatial location, meanwhile, First Order ambisonics is used at the same time in the piece to create environments where there is a less distinct sense of discrete place. Ambisonics is unique in enabling a combination of different orders to be used in the same production process, and I've chosen to take advantage of this artistically to create spatial contrasts.

The results of the panning have been decoded to 8 loudspeaker channels arranged in a circular configuration, with two separate sub-bass channels.

If you do not posses sub-woofers, then the sub-bass channels should be mixed into the main feeds as appropriate to your venue. 

If you do posses sub-woofers, these should be calibrated to replay +10dB above main content.

There is a useful explanation (aimed at a  developer audience [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5grYMXbAV0][here]]).

In addition to performing, you can modify the work and participate in further developing this piece. For this you will need your own account at GitHub ([[https://github.com/join][sign up here]]), and click the 'Fork' button which appears on this page. You'll then have your own copy, and it will link directly back to this original (preserving the terms of the creative commons license). You can change it or make modifications. If you then make a 'pull-request', your changes can be merged back into the project and attributed. 

*If you simply wish to perform the work as is, then you don't need an account at GitHub*. Just download the zip (compressed archive file, which you'll need to unpack - your computer will most likely do this automatically) as above.

 Also, GitHub permits you to submit 'bugs' and 'issues': ideal for tracking any questions or comments you might have with rehearsing the work.
